google_gift_exchange
====================

This is a gift exchange I wrote that uses a Google Spreadsheet CSV export as
the admin interface.  It reads the CSV and presents a live web interface
showing which gifts are unopened and who is holding each gift.  It also shows
which gifts are "locked" and unavalable for stealing.  There is no logic,
that's all implimented by the human managing the spreadsheet.
